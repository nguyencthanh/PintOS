<title>Why did my computer turn off when the battery got to 10%?</title>

<p>When the charge level of the battery gets too low, your computer will
automatically turn off. It does this to make sure that the battery does not
completely discharge, since this is bad for
the battery. If the battery just ran out, the computer would not have time to
shut down properly either.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that when your computer automatically turns off, your
applications and documents <em>are not</em> saved. To avoid losing your
work, save it before the battery gets too low.</p>
