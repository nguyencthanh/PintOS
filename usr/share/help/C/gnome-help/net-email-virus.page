  <title>Do I need to scan my emails for viruses?</title>

  <p>Viruses are programs that cause problems if they manage to find their way
  onto your computer. A common way of them getting onto your computer is
  through email messages.</p>

  <p>Viruses that can affect computers running Linux are quite rare, so you are
  <link xref="net-antivirus">unlikely to get a virus through email or
  otherwise</link>. If you receive an email with a virus hidden in it, it will
  probably have no effect on your computer. As such, you probably don't need to
  scan your email for viruses.</p>

  <p>You may, however, wish to scan your email for viruses in case you happen
  to forward a virus from one person to another. For example, if one of your
  friends has a Windows computer with a virus and sends you a virus-infected
  email, and you then forward that email to another friend with a Windows
  computer, then the second friend might get the virus too. You could install
  an anti-virus application to scan your emails to prevent this, but it's
  unlikely to happen and most people using Windows and Mac OS have anti-virus
  software of their own anyway.</p>
